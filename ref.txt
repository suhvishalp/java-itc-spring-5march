Package Management tools / Dependency management / build tools
----------------------------------------------------------- 
    - Maven
    - Gradle

Spring Framework
------------------
    - The Spring Framework is a mature, powerful and highly flexible framework 
        focused on building applications in Java.

        Spring Modules : 

            - Spring Core 
                - Core (spring-core) is the core of the framework that power 
                    features such as Inversion of Control and dependency injection.

                    - Spring Beans
                        - Beans (spring-beans) provides Beanfactory, which is a 
                            sophisticated implementation of the factory pattern
                    - spring context 
                    - expression language

            - Spring Web 

            - Spring REST 

            - Spring Security

            - Spring DATA 

            - Spring AOP

            - Spring Cloud  

            - Spring Boot 



    Environment Setup 
    ---------------------------
        - java 8 or 11 
        - Eclipse IDE       or     Spring Tool Suite        or Intelij Idea 
        - mysql community server database




    Common Terminologies / coding conventions 
    ---------------------

    BO - business objects 
         - write code to represent business entities 
            - ie. Customer, Order, Transaction, Supplier, etc.

    Service classes 
        - write code that represents business logic  
            ie. CustomerService, OrderService, etc. 


    Inversion of Control / IOC
        - it is a process / mechanism to delegate the responsibility of creating objects 
            to a "Container"


    Dependency Injection
        - Connecting objects with other objects / or “injecting” objects into other objects,

    Spring Container
        - it manages the life cycle of objects. 
            - object creation 
            - initialization 
            - destroy

    
    Scope types 
    ------------

        1. singleton 
            - this is the default scope container uses to create objects 

        2. prototype 

        3. request 

        4. session 

        5. application 


    Spring Bean Definition 
    ----------------------
        -   it is a configuration to describe how object should be created
